- New Item appears at the end of the list.
- If all Items are completed, Total Active is shown as -1 instead of 0.

    - Instead of expanding\contracting it marks all Items as either done or not done.
    - Color change of the arrow happens only on a 3rd click.
- Clear function only clears completed.
- Adding a VEEERY long Item takes too long to add\hangs the app.
    - Amending a VEEERY long Item crashes app.
